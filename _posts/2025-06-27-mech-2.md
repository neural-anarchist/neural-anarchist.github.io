### Problem - Difficulty: 4(out of 9)

In the elastic collision of a particle of mass $$ m_1 $$ and initial velocity $$ v_0 $$ with a stationary particle of mass $$ m_2 $$, set the deflection angle of $m_1$ as $\theta_1$, show that the **maximum deflection angle** $$ \theta_m $$ of $$ m_1 $$ in the lab frame satisfies:

$$
\cos^2 \theta_m = 1 - \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2
$$

When $$ m_1 > m_2 $$.<br>

Hence, show that:
- $$(a) \quad 0 \leq \theta_m \leq \frac{\pi}{2} $$ when $$ m_1 > m_2 $$
- $$(b) \quad 0 < \theta_1 \leq \pi $$ when $$ m_1 < m_2 $$

### Solution

Let the initial speed of particle $$ m_1 $$ in the lab frame be $$ v_0 $$, and particle $$ m_2 $$ be initially at rest. To simplify the analysis, we move to the **center of mass (CM) frame**, where:

$$
v_{\text{CM}} = \frac{m_1 v_0}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

The velocity of $$ m_1 $$ in the CM frame before collision is:

$$
v_1' = v_0 - v_{\text{CM}} = v_0 - \frac{m_1 v_0}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{m_2 v_0}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

In the CM frame, due to conservation of kinetic energy and symmetry of elastic collisions, the **magnitude** of the velocity of $$ m_1 $$ remains constant, but its **direction** changes. Let $$ \alpha $$ be the angle between $$ v_1' $$ before and after collision in the CM frame.

Now, transform the velocity back to the **lab frame**. After the collision, the velocity of $$ m_1 $$ in the lab frame is:

$$
v_1^{\text{(lab)}} = v_1'^{\text{(after)}} + v_{\text{CM}}
$$

Assuming $$ v_1'^{\text{(after)}} $$ makes angle $$ \alpha $$ with the original direction, we decompose:

$$
v_{x}^{\text{lab}} = v_1' \cos \alpha + v_{\text{CM}}, \quad
v_{y}^{\text{lab}} = v_1' \sin \alpha
$$

So, the deflection angle $$ \theta $$ in the lab frame is:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{v_1' \sin \alpha}{v_1' \cos \alpha + v_{\text{CM}}}\right)
= \arctan\left(\frac{m_2 \sin \alpha}{m_2 \cos \alpha + m_1}\right)
$$

To find the **maximum** value of $$ \theta $$, we set $$ \theta = \theta_m $$ when the denominator is minimized. This occurs when:

$$
\cos \alpha = -\frac{m_1}{m_2}
\quad \text{(only possible when } m_2 > m_1 \text{)}
$$

However, to obtain a general bound, consider the trigonometric identity:

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{m_2 \sin \alpha}{m_2 \cos \alpha + m_1} \quad (*)
$$

Let us define:

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{m_2}{\sqrt{m_1^2 - m_2^2}}
$$

Then:

$$
\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2}
\Rightarrow \cos^2 \theta = 1 - \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2
$$

Thus, the **maximum deflection angle** satisfies:

$$
\boxed{\cos^2 \theta_m = 1 - \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2}
$$

As a result:
- $(a)$ When $$ m_1 > m_2 $$, $$ \theta_m \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right] $$ is a result of considering the range and limit cases of $(*)$
- $(b)$ When $$ m_1 < m_2 $$, we analyse euqation $(*)$, and we notice that it ranges through $$(- \infty,\infty)$$, therefore we certainly have $$0 < \theta_1 \leq \pi $$


### Remark:

This is a cool trigonometry construction in physics! Reminds me of the annoying trig substitution in Calculus II, but after all just drawing triangles - how hard could that be?
