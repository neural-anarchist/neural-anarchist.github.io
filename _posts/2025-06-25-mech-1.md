Lol I'm back, this time with a problem that almost drived me crazy...

### Difficulty: 4.5(out of 9)

<br>I must say for those who are good at physics this is honestly not too bad, but I haven't seen many problems like this that requires integral + vector calculus yet, and currently my sense of intuition is just so bad...<br><br>

A massless rope is tossed over a wooden dowel of radius $r$ in order to lift a heavy object of weight $W$ off of the floor, as shown in the figure below. The coefficient of sliding friction between the rope and the dowel is $\mu$. Show that the minimum downward pull on the rope necessary to lift the object is:
<p>
\[F_{down} = We^{\pi\mu}\]

  }

Uh... This looks so nasty - because it's not a frictionless pulley! And we don't like ts...

However, at least the rope is massless...

### Hint: split the curve into small arcs, think about the force balance of every single arc, are the tension forces uniformly distributed along the rope?

    Summary: get inspired from the proof of the magnitude of centripetal accelerations from uniform circular motion, take a small displacement on the circle, and make it approach zero!

    One intuitive approach is to start by thinking about what happens when the forces on the two sides are the same - as for a frictionless pulley. In that case, one might think the weight will be lifted - no, or more rigorously, if and only if the weight is somehow in the air. In reality the weight will remain static, because friction on the wooden dowel will "eat up" the tension force given by $F_{down}$ bit by bit and eventually much less than $W$ when it reaches the other side.<br><br>
    This thought experiment gives us a strong intuition to see that $W$ causes the rope to gain a normal force at each point on the pulley, which creates friction, the friction adds up along the curve, and eventually becoming the magnitude of the desired $F_{down}$ on the other side.<br><br>

    So what about let's just take two close points on the arc then? <br><br>

    In the figure on the left below we see that we can form a triangle (the arc is approximated as a segment) with long side $T$ and short side
    $‚àÜN$. In the figure on the right below we see a triangle with long side $r$ and short side $r‚àÜŒ∏$. These
    triangles are similar, so $\frac{r}{‚àÜŒ∏r} = \frac{‚àÜN}{T}$.<br><br>

    So,

        \[
        \Delta N = T \Delta\theta \implies dN =T d\theta \quad (1)
        \]

    For friction, we have $‚àÜf=\mu ‚àÜN \quad (2)$.<br><br>

    Crucially, we should notice that the $T$ here is the final, equalized forces in of tension in the two directions, specifically:
    \[T = \vert \vec{T}(\theta) \vert = \vert \vec{T}(\theta+‚àÜŒ∏)-\vec{‚àÜf} \vert\]


    We take the magnitude:
    \[ T(\theta) = T(\theta+‚àÜŒ∏)-‚àÜf \]

    And we see as $\theta \longrightarrow 0$, this equation simply becomes:

    \[dT = df \quad (3)\]

    
    Finally we plug $(3)$ into $(2)$ and then into $(1)$, and we get

        \[
        \frac{dT}{T} = \mu\,d\theta
        \Rightarrow \int_{T_0}^{T_{\pi}} \frac{dT}{T} = \mu \int_0^{\pi} d\theta
        \Rightarrow \ln\left( \frac{T_{\pi}}{T_0} \right) = \mu \pi
        \Rightarrow T_{\pi} = T_0 e^{\mu \pi}
        \]

        Since \( T_0 = W \) is the tension on the weight side, and \( T_{\pi} = F_{\text{down}} \), the force we apply must be:

        \[
        F_{\text{down}} = W e^{\mu \pi}
        \]

    Fully understanding this problem + writing this solution took me hours(rip), there are actually mulitple ways to prove it but this one is the most elegant in my perspective.

### Remark: 

This is actually - implicitly - exactly the _Capstan equation_, which is a neat generalization (though we've basically proved the whole thing already), check it out [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstan_equation).
