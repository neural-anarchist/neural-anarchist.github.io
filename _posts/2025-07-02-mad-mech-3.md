Double post let's go~

## Problem

**How can we prove, using only elementary knowledge, that a uniform cube has the same moment of inertia about any axis through its center?**

---


## Solution

<p>
We aim to show that a uniform cube (of mass \( M \) and side length \( 2a \), doesn't really matter here) has the same moment of inertia about any axis through its center, using only basic geometry, calculus, and symmetry — no tensors or advanced machinery.

### Setup Using the Definition of Moment of Inertia

<p>
For a rigid body rotating about an axis in direction \( \vec{n} \) through the origin, the moment of inertia is:
</p>
<div class="math-display">$$
I_{\vec{n}} = \int_V \rho \, \left| \vec{r} \times \vec{n} \right|^2 \, dV
$$</div>

Here:


- $ \vec{r} = (x, y, z) $ is the position vector.
- $ \vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z) $is a **unit vector** in the direction of the axis.
- $ \rho $ is the **constant** mass density of the cube.
- The cube is centered at the origin, extending from $ -a $ to $ a $ in all directions.


Use the identity:


<div class="math-display">$$
\left| \vec{r} \times \vec{n} \right|^2 = |\vec{r}|^2 |\vec{n}|^2 - (\vec{r} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x n_x + y n_y + z n_z)^2
$$</div>

Thus, the moment of inertia becomes:

<div class="math-display">$$
I_{\vec{n}} = \rho \int_V \left( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x n_x + y n_y + z n_z)^2 \right) dV
$$</div>

---

### Expand and Simplify

First, expand the squared term:

<div class="math-display">$$
(x n_x + y n_y + z n_z)^2 = x^2 n_x^2 + y^2 n_y^2 + z^2 n_z^2 + 2xy n_x n_y + 2xz n_x n_z + 2yz n_y n_z
$$</div>

Substitute back:

<div class="math-display">$$
I_{\vec{n}} = \rho \int_V \left[
x^2(1 - n_x^2) + y^2(1 - n_y^2) + z^2(1 - n_z^2)
- 2xy n_x n_y - 2xz n_x n_z - 2yz n_y n_z
\right] dV
$$</div>

---

### Using Symmetry of the Cube


The cube is symmetric with respect to all coordinate axes:

- Integrals of odd functions (like $ xy, xz, yz $) over the volume **cancel to zero**:

<div class="math-display">$$
\int_V xy \, dV = \int_V xz \, dV = \int_V yz \, dV = 0
$$</div>

- Integrals of $ x^2, y^2, z^2 $ are **equal** by symmetry:

<div class="math-display">$$
\int_V x^2 \, dV = \int_V y^2 \, dV = \int_V z^2 \, dV = A
$$</div>

So the integral becomes:

<div class="math-display">$$
I_{\vec{n}} = \rho \left[
A(1 - n_x^2) + A(1 - n_y^2) + A(1 - n_z^2)
\right]
= \rho A \left[ 3 - (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) \right]
$$</div>

---

### Finishing up Using the Unit Vector Identity

Since $ \vec{n} $ is a **unit vector**, we have:

<div class="math-display">$$
n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1
$$</div>

So the expression becomes:

<div class="math-display">$$
I_{\vec{n}} = \rho A (3 - 1) = 2 \rho A
$$</div>

This is a **constant**, independent of the direction of $ \vec{n} $. Therefore, the moment of inertia is the **same for all axes through the center**.

## Thoughts:
Classical mechanics is actually **insanely fun**!

It’s just a shame my math background is too limited, otherwise these chapters on rotational dynamics would be even more enjoyable (at least I do understand the cross-product, so whatever...知足常乐).

Multi-var-calc is the math course I'm taking next semester, but at this point, it looks like I’ll have to start early.

With physics, it really feels like there’s no such thing as knowing _too much_ math!

If you wonder why I've been so "productive" - thanks to AI for helping me code out the solutions lol. Teach an LLM the solution and let it compile the raw code for you - Feynman learning technique + Efficiency = win-win.
