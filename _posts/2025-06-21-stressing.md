### _Xook._
Since this is a math post, I'll try my best to use all the mathy vocabulary I know (feel free to correct my "grammar" in the comments), and NO MORE literary devices — _rbonks_ what a relief...
<br><br>
Recently, I encountered some Chinese math olympiad people online (some of them are actually alumni from my former high school).
<br><br>
Apparently, they are masters of "show, don’t tell."
<br><br>
And they showed me two things:

1. They are as _orz_ as _xiooix_.

2. I'm so _zro_.
<br><br>

Even though this lowkey pmo, it’s honestly crazy how much they’ve enhanced in just a year! There are basically no geo or alg problems they can’t solve by now. However, it seems like most US and Chinese math kids still find olympiad-level combo pretty challenging. Thankfully, one of them introduced me to a lecture series that might help — surprisingly, it’s taught by a well-known professor I actually recognize - he does teach you some solid intuitions, which is more manageable for me compared to OTIS.

But while I grind his material on combo and NT, I also need to lock in on computational problems — where the Chinese kids are definitely weaker than the Americans — probably because they get way less practice on those.

Looking at my bookshelf — ~~“AoPS Intermediate Counting and Probability” here we go again.~~

In fact, after quickly skimming through 5 chapters today, I actually feel a bit of hope — combo’s pretty fun after all!

If you're reading this and you're not a combo main, I wish you the best of luck (also gl to myself).

cuz some orz Chinese dude literally claimed:

### 搞数竞别想偏科，当你对组合数一窍不通时就已经与国集失之交臂了。

_Xor._ Let’s say this is unlikely true for the US — otherwise 90%+ of the math kids are getting instantly ratio’d.

In China, combo problems already tend to appear early in the set — like P1 or P2 level. If that ever happens to USAMO - it’s gonna be a total cookout 💀.

Hopefully on the next math post, I'll include some actual math lol.

It's pretty late now and I need to get enough rest for my birthday tomorrow!
