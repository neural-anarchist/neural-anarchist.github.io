I finally got my professional recording equipment! Goodbye to voice memos!!!

Recorded an acoustic backing track, layered in an electric guitar line (why is it so hard to keep it clean...), and added another acoustic track to trace the vocal melodies.

Mad love to my favorite Japanese rock band and one of the most unforgettable animes I've watched!!!
