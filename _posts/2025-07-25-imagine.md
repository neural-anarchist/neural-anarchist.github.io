## Intro

I’ve never agreed with _everything_ John did — his “Lennon” way of life could be wild, even reckless at times. But there’s no doubt that he created masterpieces like _Imagine_, and for that, he stands as a true legend in music history as he deserves.

It’s heartbreaking that his life was cut short. And even if he had lived to this day, we’re now entering a painful era — many of the rock icons I grew up idolizing are reaching their twilight years. Just three days ago, we lost Ozzy Osbourne forever. 

Rest in peace. :sob:

...These years are going to be tough for me...


Still, we must keep looking ahead, because the spring of art never stops gushing with innovation.

Life is truly beautiful when you stumble upon and suddenly comprehend a spark of subtle design.

## Lyrics

<div class="lyrics">
  <p>
    Imagine there's no heaven<br>
    It's easy if you try<br>
    No hell below us<br>
    Above us, only sky<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Livin' for today<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Imagine there's no countries<br>
    It isn't hard to do<br>
    Nothing to kill or die for<br>
    And no religion, too<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Livin' life in peace
  </p>

  <p>
    You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
    But I'm not the only one<br>
    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
    And the world will be as one
  </p>

  <p>
    Imagine no possessions<br>
    I wonder if you can<br>
    No need for greed or hunger<br>
    A brotherhood of man<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Sharing all the world
  </p>

  <p>
    You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
    But I'm not the only one<br>
    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
    And the world will live as one
  </p>
</div>
