## Preface:

Being someone with a relatively diverse cultural background and a habit of viewing societal phenomena as soap operas, I'll be spamming some of my totally discrete thoughts — what some might call “philosophy” into blog these posts whenever the mood strikes.

When people talk about **philosophy**, the great minds of human history often come to mind first: Socrates, Plato, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche… But in this post, while not denying the implicit influence they may or may not have had on me, I want to explicitly ignore their theories of the human mind and instead grant the entirety of my true self some freedom.

So first of all, what exactly is philosophy?

Here’s the textbook definition:

>"Philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom and understanding regarding the most general and abstract aspects of the world >and our place in it. It investigates concepts such as truth, morality, beauty, freedom, consciousness, and justice."

...and to me, this definition _smells_ like one of those obscure humanities classes I respect but don’t particularly enjoy.

So let’s keep it simpler, simple enough for anyone to grasp at a glance.

## _Philosophy is the collection of all human knowledge._

There are analogies: “Collection of all” corresponds to “the most general and abstract aspects of the world and our place in it” from the formal definition, while “human knowledge” aligns with “wisdom and understanding” and all those insane concepts.

Now someone might ask: "_Where did the verb go? You forgot the 'pursuit' part!_"

Great point! But here, ‘collection’ itself implies action, and it’s us — all human beings who are doing the collecting.

Philosophy is often glorified by those who study it professionally, but honestly, everyone is a philosopher. We are constantly living out and refining our own philosophies, and in doing so, we contribute to the collective human understanding.

It’s easy to see why the subject gets so much admiration — philosophy might actually be the hardest discipline on Earth. It deals with the validation of all human knowledge: from the arithmetic of 1+1, to rocket science and machine learning models; from ancient Chinese inscriptions on oracle bones to the enlightening ideas of the Renaissance. As long as we are receiving inputs (reading) and producing outputs (writing, coding, creating), we are learning and contributing to human philosophy.

If I expand further, this might start to touch on the debate between Materialism and Idealism lol. The key idea is this: every person is unique, and people differ more than we can imagine. Even though our genes limit us in certain basic ways (e.g. we can't behave like rats), we still differ deeply in how we learn, think, and create.

That’s why I personally choose not to study philosophical masterpieces too deeply (~~and let them linger in my mouth and mind all the time~~). It’s not that they lack value, but because we — me and those thinkers, can never completely agree. And disagreement, at its worst, leads to misery.

So, be critical of everything I say here too! To me, the ultimate purpose of thought and philosophy is to explore the random questions that frequently arise in life, and to test our ideas through living — gradually approaching what we call truth.

Furthermore I believe that there shouldn't be a universal truth, and even if there is one, people would interpret it differently. Therefore, one should better focus on a way to feel complete or feel like **becoming** complete.

## Imitations & Actions

Yet almost everyone - including me, loves to imitate others, both in action and value. 

This makes sense: I am a student and the role of a student is to learn from others (things you learn from textbooks are the wisdom of others - their philosophy!). But there's also a problem that cannot be smoothly resolved: someday we will not be students anymore, and what should we do next? - Imitate every single person you find interesting since there's no "fixed" track anymore? But there are numerous people on this planet, many of whom have respectable depth. Many of them might even have the exact opposite opinions on some questions in life, and still they're all "considered" successful.

The main issue is this: we simply cannot “try to become” anyone else, nor can we fully believe in thoughts just because someone else produced them. We are all trapped in this 3D world, where all “truths” are really just those that work well for **you**. That’s the function of our intellect—how our brain processes experience into action.

So I guess at every changing instant, I'm freed from my past self, since I've traveled further in time and have "experienced more".

As an essay, what I’ve just written is arguably a failure, because I didn’t include any examples to make my perspective feel “stronger.” But perhaps that’s exactly why we need philosophy: no one shares the exact same experiences or knowledge as anyone else, so there's no need to "force" personal observations to others while introducing an again _personal_ philosophy. We extract the abstract essence of our thoughts in order to communicate them, and absorb the theories of others as well. Both methods let us feel more complete: denser through the former and more spacious via the latter (~~do you get the physics metaphor here?~~).

Next time I might talk more about some specific values and experiences that happened to exist within my life.
