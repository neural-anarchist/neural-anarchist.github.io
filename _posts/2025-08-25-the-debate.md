Lately I've been asking myself, "How does it feel?" — writing songs all alone on a windy night, occasionally looking up at the dark and cloudy sky, listening to the chanting of cicadas - somewhat identical to my past few years. I've tried infinite chord progressions on the guitar, while the lyrics just wouldn't come out.

I can't say this is idealism confining my creativity, since I don't think the songs I've written are that good. Instead, perhaps it reveals some of my inferiority when facing, well, life in general.

I dreamed of a complete transformation of myself within this year in a new environment, but it occurs to me that my core is far too stubborn to be moved. Did I really gain anything from this trip through the ether? I gained very little: aside from the new skills, new values, and new friends (which I deeply appreciate), I am still the old me when dealing with anything practical. Whatever I attempt to conceal traces of the past, an awkward sound of warning arises from somewhere unreachable and rips off these layers of hypocrisy.

## The Debate
So the subject worth debating is how I should treat the vulnerability and guide my first instincts through tasks and thoughts.

All the Chinese education I've been exposed to collectively leads to a form of aposteriorism: people are always "keen" on telling you what you should and shouldn't do, "helping" you picture your own future, and are insanely interested in what others have done so that they can "learn" from the experience.

What a **nutshell**.

The seemingly prevailing apriorism in the U.S., however, does no good either. There are a plentiful number of diverse life paths that people have taken and succeeded on by stumbling. Those who care would have observed these cases and may have interesting interpretations that usually differ. For those who simply don't desire that much—they receive "values" from the internet, and everyone sane knows the consequences.

What a **nut-stew**.

Nevertheless, these were the two subconscious influences that affected me so much, as a young but aging pupil who was meant to go astray.

Dramatically, a majority of my friends in China never seem to have pondered their life trajectory after college, while my new friends or acquaintances in the U.S. are already trying to "accomplish" what one may consider a life-long objective.

Perhaps it only means that there will never be a single abstract answer for meaning, but paradoxically, infinite ones. Even if culture and biological behaviors may vastly shape the way people think and react, it is worth considering how significant the influence of the individuals we meet in our lives can be. I'm not trying to state the famous quote "hell is other people" in a long-winded manner. What really should be emphasized instead is the realization of how "_I_" could be important to my surroundings in many unexpected ways. It is not about "learning" from others' experiences nor about analyzing success through other people. It's simply about how to consult, make deals, or even forgive the awkward sound of inner vulnerability, while never hesitating to search for or inquire about information from all perspectives, so that I know at least basic _ignorance_ wouldn't be standing in my way.

The debate is over. 

The subjects I am passionate about are a matter of conscience, the things I shall never abandon, no matter how well it seems to fit in this world.

## A Digression
Although summertime is short as always, I've managed to finish the full HRK Volume 1! It really did cook my brain, stuffing Classical Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, Waves, Special Relativity, and Thermodynamics baked with weird calculus knowledge all into this already shivering mind. But knowledge never fails you, as one of the only invariants within the limits of one's life.

I also realized that I somehow saved the two menacing beasts - Electro-Magnitism and Quantum Mechanics to the end. I guess it's going to be year full of physics _fun_.
