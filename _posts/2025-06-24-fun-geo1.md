### Difficulty: 4 (out of 9)
Let $$ABCD$$ be a rhombus with $$AB = 5$$ and $$AC = 8$$. $$E$$ lies on ray $$AD$$, connect $$BE$$, and let $$\triangle FBE$$ be the reflection of $$\triangle ABE$$ over line $$BE$$.  
Suppose $$EF$$ intersects ray $$AC$$ at point $$P$$.  
Connect $BP$, compute the minimum possible value of $$PA - PB$$.

    Auxiliary lines: We drop perpendiculars from $B$ to $AD$ and $AC$, intersecting at $G$, $Q$ respectively.

    Since we are dealing with the lengths $PA$ and $PB$, we try to find connections between them.
    Set $PB = x$, therefore $PG = \sqrt{x^2-9}$.<br>
    So we have:
    \[PA-PB = \sqrt{x^2-9}+4-x\]
    Without thinking about differentiation, we manipulate this algebraic expression, which is key to this question:
    \[\sqrt{x^2-9}+4-x = 4 + \frac{-9}{\sqrt{x^2-9}+x}\]
    Now, looking at the right hand side, we realize that we need to minimize $x$ in order to achieve the minimum. (as long as $x>3$)
    <br>
    But when does that happen? There is a certain range for $PB$ since it's a line segment, that's for sure.<br>
    We notice that $B$ is a fixed point, and that $P$ is always on $EF$. But $EF$ is not static though, hmmmm...
    Wait, but $EF$ is the reflection of $AE$, and $AE$ is static!<br>
    Thus, the minimum value of $PB$ can be achieved when $PB$ is perpendicular to $EF$, and utilizing symmetry, it suffices to compute $BQ$, and substituting it back as $x$.<br>
    We have infinite ways to get $BQ = \frac{24}{5}$.<br>
    Now,
    \[\min(PA-PB) = \sqrt{(\frac{24}{5})^2-9}+4-\frac{24}{5} = \boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{39}-4}{5}}\]

    Holy latex practice!

### Remark:
<p>
I'm including this problem since it is the last problem from 2025 ÊµôÊ±üÁúÅ‰∏≠ËÄÉÊï∞Â≠¶, and approximately a year ago when I took the 2024 test, I was so zro that I was only able to solved the last problem in the final 5 minutes, scribbling my answer frantically onto the answer sheet. Now, these problems just feel 5RO and this is a farewell to problems like this.
