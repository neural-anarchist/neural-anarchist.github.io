### It was the last day of school today... <br>
What an interesting 11 months it's been. <br>
<br>
Within these 11 months, I’ve moved across the planet. <br>
Within these 11 months, I’ve savored American food whenever I want — a dream I’d held for years. <br>
Within these 11 months, I’ve left behind familiar streets and faces, stepping into a world both exciting and strange.<br>
Also within these 11 months, I realized just how tunnel-visioned I had been all along... <br> <br><br>

Morning runs really get the brain moving and the thoughts spinning — especially in that half-hungry, half-nauseous state where your body isn’t sure if it’s waking up or shutting down. At the start, everything feels possible. You convince yourself you’re strong enough to run far, fast, light as air.
<br><br>
But then the run begins.
<br><br>
Your legs tighten like coiled rope. Your breath turns shallow, and every step echoes in your head like a warning. The rhythm that once felt effortless becomes a negotiation: one more step, then another. Your throat burns. Your stomach clenches. The air tastes like salt on metal.
<br><br><br>
How often we begin with illusions of ease and clarity, only to find ourselves deep in the middle of something harder, messier, more painful than we imagined. And just like running, there’s no miracle or shortcut. The only way out is through. You pace yourself. You breathe. You break the journey down into steps, and you learn to keep going, not because it feels good — but because you chose this path, and you’re becoming stronger with every aching mile.
<br><br><br>

### At first glance, this might seem like just some random post themed around "effort and achievement."
<br><br>
Yet just a year ago, in the spring of 2024, it was me, I **was** sprinting through life.
<br><br>
Picture this: a group of boys biking through the humid evening breeze on the clamorous streets of Hangzhou, not heading home, but riding straight to the library. We weren't rebels or dreamers. We were just like everyone else — pouring over the same material day after day, drilling the same practice exams by the dozen, all in preparation for the Chinese High School Entrance Examination. We believed, deeply and earnestly, that this was what life was about: working hard, pushing through, and earning our place. If we gave everything, we’d get into the best high schools in the province...
<br><br>
And we certainly did.
<br><br>
But was that it? Was it enough?
<br><br>
When I moved to America last summer, I brought that same mindset with me: starting to grind math and physics competitions, getting a GPA above 4.0, and all sorts of academic endeavors — I believed these were the only things that mattered. I believed success came only to those who kept sprinting without rest.
<br><br>
But slowly, almost unnoticeably, life here began to show me something different. 
<br><br>

### The wonder of life is never about winning the race.
<br><br>
But in friendships built over spontaneous conversations, in morning sprints where the sun rose as you breathed the foggy air, in harmless pranks that left us laughing, in jam sessions and those crazy noises we make, late-night walks, last-day-of-school pizza party, questions made by AI that didn’t have answers, and the quiet appreciation for those whose presence in your life kept you going — who encouraged you, inspired you, and reignited your fire when it dimmed.
<br><br>
Yet the sprint was never wrong — it’s the directionless sprint that leads us into darkness. Running faster doesn’t help if you’re going in circles, 
<br><br>
The wonder of life often happens when we pause, when we take time to look around, to reflect, to enjoy the great sceneries along the road. Maybe even to photograph the road behind us or invent a better way forward — a bicycle, a car, or something entirely our own.
<br><br>
That’s when the tunnel vision lifts. That’s when the world widens.
<br><br>
Life isn’t about running endlessly — it’s about moving with purpose, resting with intention, and seeing with clarity.
<br><br>
And maybe, living fully isn’t about how far you go — but about how deeply you see.
<br><br><br>
**Still, without the ability to sprint fast and endure the pain, all this talk is just empty words.**
<br>

### LOLLLLLLL
