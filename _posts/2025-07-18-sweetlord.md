Technically, _My Sweet Lord_ isn‚Äôt a Beatles song ‚Äî but it might as well be. It comes from the band's iconic lead guitarist, George Harrison, who‚Äôs made more than one appearance on this blog already. 

Harrison possesses a deeply spiritual soul. Unlike most rock stars, he didn‚Äôt tie himself to a single religion. Instead, his faith flowed freely between cultures, and _My Sweet Lord_ reflects that beautifully. It blends Christian ‚ÄúHallelujahs‚Äù with Hindu ‚ÄúHare Krishna,‚Äù creating a song that breaks religious boundaries and becomes a kind of universal prayer.

To me, this is more than just a song ‚Äî it‚Äôs a genuine offering. Which is perfect an occasion like today, the one-year anniversary of the release of ChatGPT-4o (a tool that literally represents the future lmao). 

I will record more takes since this one has a LOT of details for me to imporve. This is also my first time trying this singing style - it's pretty hard to get the emotions accurate.

<br> _Abstract of the lyrics: Really wanna be with you my lord!_

<br> You get the idea...

<br> Completed recording of the full song, including vocals, two electric guitar solos, and an additional jazzy acoustic guitar solo (near the end) as an enrichment to the original.

I spent an hour wrestling with the two guitar-slide solos ‚Äî and am still not quite satisfied. The solos require blending two separate e-guitar tracks, and getting the phrasing and tone to match perfectly has proven harder than I imagined. That‚Äôll be my main focus in future takes I plan to re-record this weekend.

Also, I‚Äôll be launching a new _Philosophy_ category soon: a sandbox of daydreams and nightmares...


### üé∏ Shoutout

Big shoutout to my guitar teacher ‚Äî who's guided me during the past 4 years in all things music, for laying down the rhythm guitar tracks (using a 12-string guitar!!! -wish I had one of those) and isolating the bass and drum stems for me. 

We'll be working on a couple of pieces each week from now on - including some work-in-progress songs that I've composed recently.

### Other Stuff

I may or may not expand on this in future blog posts, but‚ÄîI just wrapped up my first official project this past week, working with my groupmates on the camp‚Äôs midterm assignment. It was intense. Spending over 12 hours wrestling with code felt like a trailer of research life (hmmm or perhaps I wouldn't end up living one). And now I‚Äôm genuinely worried about the final project, which will need to be rigorous enough to qualify as actual research...

So yeah ‚Äî RIP to my sleep schedule, my physics and math time, and my morning runs. This week was supposed to mark the one-month anniversary of my morning run streak, and it all came crashing down. (I tried sleeping at midnight and waking at 5:30. Turns out... I‚Äôm not built to be a programmer.)
