Hey, I'm back.

This time with more pigments to decorate this website.

First of all, I'm starting a particular "Physics Club" section to archive all the handouts and later maybe mock tests that we make. I've encourtered too many facinating ideas and problems since school started, so I guess weekly handouts would make more sense than a dozen of blog posts.

Next is the "Music" tab, a place where I hope to one day share my own ‘masterpiece’ recordings (if I ever reach that level), and preserve the memories of my band.

Then there’s the "Life" tab. The title may sound generic, but it’s where I’ll keep my most unfiltered takes. It will likely be evolving a lot, much like the art board wall in my home that inspired it.
