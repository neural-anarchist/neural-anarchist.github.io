## Eric Clapton is GOD!!!

But just like any human-being, a god suffers too. 

Eric Clapton is called god — and for good reason. From his fiery solos with Cream (love the song _Badge_ which he wrote with his friend George) to the smooth blues of Layla and Wonderful Tonight, Clapton helped define what modern blues guitar sounds like. But behind the glory was a man in pain. For years, Clapton struggled with alcoholism and heroin addiction, nearly destroying his career and life in the 1970s.

Then came an even deeper tragedy — in 1991, his four-year-old son, Conor, fell to his death out from a window by accident. Devastated, Clapton poured his grief into the song _Tears in Heaven_. It was a raw, honest cry from a man the world saw as untouchable.

### Lyrics:

<div class="lyrics">
  <p>
    Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?<br>
    Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?<br>
    I must be strong and carry on,<br>
    'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.
    </p>

    <p>
    Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?<br>
    Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?<br>
    I'll find my way through night and day,<br>
    'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.
    </p>

    <p>
    Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees.<br>
    Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please.
    </p>

    <p>
    Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure,<br>
    And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.
    </p>

</div>


### Random yap:

Right now, I'm somehow forced to dash through Calculus III in two days. With any luck, I’ll finish the rest tomorrow. The days have felt brutally short, stretched thin like worn fabric. Even my singing sounds faint — stripped of its usual strength.

But strangely, in the middle of all this exhaustion, there's also something else. A kind of subtle, electrifying joy. Learning math — further math - any math — is eerily intoxicating. Machine learning and physics demand so much from it, and the more I learn, the more I realize how deep this rabbit hole goes.

It’s insane. Instead of a subject — it’s more like a portal that I'm willingly falling into.
