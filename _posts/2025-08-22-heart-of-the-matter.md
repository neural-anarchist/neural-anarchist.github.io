I felt bad for breaking my "I'll post more" promise and not posting for three weeks.

These weeks were brief; I broke my routine after a couple of short trips, which made me think of not traveling for a while.

Paradoxically, trips always make me reflect upon the present: my presence, my stance, and my perspective on the discrete matters in this world.

It took me a long time to digest some of this, and I don't think I've figured out anything considerably remarkable yet, but I believe it's time to jot some down.

### Where mountains meet the ocean
Personally, this imagery creates a complex feeling, since there is no standard interpretation, but always more interpretations for one to perceive. Landscape paintings of such scenery are often regarded as cultural treasures throughout human history, especially in Asia, as they seem to have a legendary power of evoking enlightenment for anyone bewildered. This makes sense since the artist inevitably blends human emotion and perhaps some deeper conveying thoughts into the masterpiece, enchanting the painting to be "more" than just a scenery. Certainly, if someone is able to reach the subtlety of the art, the "big idea" would be received, and the spectator will solve the puzzle in their mind.

Yet, this is also how ideas can potentially lead one astray.

Many seem to have that subconsciousness of believing in thoughts that suddenly arose from the heart and getting so obsessed by the idea, as if it was always there, just that I had "left" it somewhere on the road.

It occurs to me that it's extremely difficult to reflect on those kinds of "ahaaa" moments when the subject is not math or science related. But these remarkable moments did seem to have built up a great chunk of my spiritual world, tossing back the thoughts that once appeared as sparks of "enlightenment." The suffering comes from doubting my interpretations that were made ages ago and trying to touch some firm ideas that have consolidated into stern beliefs, which have sunk and settled.

So, back to why these feelings may be misleading.

- Sometimes the idea could be inappropriate for that specific time. Not saying that ideas could be wrong fundamentally, but people will and do need to think differently in different stages in life to achieve emotional stability and mental well-being under varying biological conditions. Therefore, ideas that are not suitable for the present could be a hazard.

- The unstoppable nature of overthinking could be disastrous when you don't have a way to slowly process and dispose of the unnecessary.

I really overthought things recently.

In short, it was a sorrowful debate between apriorism and aposteriorism ideas that haunted me and shook my faith.

Faithfully, I'll just need a little more time to go through all the unpleasantness and make an agreement with my conflicting inner self. But before all that resolves and I'm able to find a balance of settling my own entropy and casting out the entropy, these many things I shall keep to myself.

And even if this process takes forever...

We are still united on that very path.

Everyone bears a unique burden from the world, but doesn't the suffering also hint a greater purpose for us to come by?

See you on the way to the other side.
