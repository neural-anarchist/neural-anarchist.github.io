Lately, I‚Äôve been returning to some Beatles pieces ‚Äî and somehow, I always end up completely immersed in this album of demos and studio deep cuts.

The most celebrated track of this album is undoubtedly "While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Demo)", mainly due to how fundamentally it differs from the studio version on the _White Album_. <br>

The stripped-down arrangement and unembellished vocals presents a clearer look into the song's original emotional intent ‚Äî less intense, but arguably more sincere. <br>

However, I still really enjoy the original studio version, mostly because it features Eric Clapton on lead guitar (as the song‚Äôs author ‚Äî George Harrison of the Beatles ‚Äî was his best friend). The solos are no joke ‚Äî the guitar god really carries the blues! <br>
(We'll talk more about this "legendary rock duo‚Äù later ‚Äî those familiar with them should know what‚Äôs coming‚Ä¶)
<br><br>
That said, this summer has turned out to be unexpectedly packed, so unfortunately, there‚Äôs not much time left for rock and roll.

### Oops, I accidentally used the studio version lyrics... (yes the demo's is different)

### Lyrics (of my demo):

<div class="lyrics">

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps 
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping  
Still my guitar gently weeps



I don't know why nobody told you  
How to unfold your love  
I don't know how someone controlled you  
They bought and sold you



I look at the world and I notice it's turning  
While my guitar gently weeps  
With every mistake we must surely be learning  
Still my guitar gently weeps



I don't know how you were diverted  
You were perverted too  
I don't know how you were inverted  
No one alerted you



I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping  
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all...  
Still my guitar gently weeps...


</div>

### Well... 
I guess that's why George Harrison was a Beatle - and I'm not, lol. 
<br> I'll keep on practicing whenever I get the chance!
