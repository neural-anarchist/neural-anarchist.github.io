Lately, I’ve been returning to some Beatles pieces — and somehow, I always end up completely immersed in this album of demos and studio deep cuts.

The most celebrated track of this album is undoubtedly "While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Demo)", mainly due to how fundamentally it differs from the studio version on the _White Album_. <br>

The stripped-down arrangement and unembellished vocals presents a clearer look into the song's original emotional intent — less intense, but arguably more sincere. <br>

However, I still really enjoy the original studio version, mostly because it features Eric Clapton on lead guitar (as the song’s author — George Harrison of the Beatles — was his best friend). The solos are no joke — the guitar god really carries the blues! <br>
(We'll talk more about this "legendary rock duo” later — those familiar with them should know what’s coming…)

That said, this summer has turned out to be unexpectedly packed, so unfortunately, there’s not much time left for rock and roll.

### Oops, I accidentally used the studio version lyrics... (yes the demo's is different)

### Lyrics (of my demo):

<div class="lyrics">
  <p>
    I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping<br>
    While my guitar gently weeps<br>
    I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping<br>
    Still my guitar gently weeps
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't know why nobody told you<br>
    How to unfold your love<br>
    I don't know how someone controlled you<br>
    They bought and sold you
  </p>

  <p>
    I look at the world and I notice it's turning<br>
    While my guitar gently weeps<br>
    With every mistake we must surely be learning<br>
    Still my guitar gently weeps
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't know how you were diverted<br>
    You were perverted too<br>
    I don't know how you were inverted<br>
    No one alerted you
  </p>

  <p>
    I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping<br>
    While my guitar gently weeps<br>
    Look at you all...<br>
    Still my guitar gently weeps...
  </p>
</div>





### Well... 
I guess that's why George Harrison was a Beatle - and I'm not, lol. 
<br> I'll keep on practicing whenever I get the chance!
