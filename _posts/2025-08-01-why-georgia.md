End of camp today! The whole experience was definitely mindblowing, and as I anticipated there would be more time for music.

### First John Mayer Song Cover!!!

The timing of this recording surprised me on two levels. First, I didn't expect to be able to perform this song's entirety so soon, as it's the most technically challenging I've tackled yet as a "frontman with a guitar". At the same time, it's been three weeks since I first started practicing the main riff, which is a personal record of practice length for me to reach "fluent" performance.

Anyways, John Mayer really is the _GOAT_, and like many other rock stars, his personal journey is **cracked**.

I'll make a full version merging the other tracks when I feel more confident about this song.

## Lyrics

<div class="lyrics">
  <p>
    I am driving up 85 in the<br>
    Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon<br>
    I'm just stuck inside the gloom<br>
    4 more exits to my apartment but<br>
    I am tempted to keep the car in drive<br>
    And leave it all behind<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    'Cause I wonder sometimes<br>
    About the outcome<br>
    Of a still verdictless life<br>
    Am I living it right?<br>
    Am I living it right?<br>
    Am I living it right?<br>
    Why, why Georgia, why?<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    I rent a room and I fill the spaces with<br>
    Wood in places to make it feel like home<br>
    But all I feel's alone<br>
    It might be a quarter life crisis<br>
    Or just the stirring in my soul<br>
    Either way I wonder sometimes<br>
    About the outcome<br>
    Of a still verdictless life<br>
    Am I living it right?<br>
    Am I living it right?<br>
    Am I living it right?<br>
    Why, why Georgia, why?<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    So what, so I've got a smile on<br>
    But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head<br>
    Don't believe me<br>
    Don't believe me<br>
    When I say I've got it down<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Everybody is just a stranger but<br>
    That's the danger in going my own way<br>
    I guess it's the price I have to pay<br>
    Still "everything happens for a reason"<br>
    Is no reason not to ask myself if I<br>
    Am living it right?<br>
    Am I living it right?<br>
    Am I living it right?<br>
    Why, tell me why,<br>
    Why, why Georgia, why?<br>
  </p>
</div>

I'm starting to think I'm gradually losing my mind after learning physics. 

The reality is: Every human, in the grand calculus of the universe, is a "negligible term" (since our universe "expands"). 

These days seem like a gray loop to me, and I'm a ghost in a gloom world, while stars continue their restless, almost annoyingly regular orbits. Comets streak past at escape velocity, I can feel their potential fading, fading, and then gone. 

I don't want to be "stuck inside the gloom" or just hit the 85 and never look back.

As a child, I often fantasized about finding people who are at my "resonace frequency", like a driven harmonic oscillator. This feeling usually occurs after a beautiful movie, and I feel in tune with some characters. But as I grew up, I realized this emotional demand gets so strong that they've narrowed my window of resonance to a point of near-negligibility. I feel like I've been living in a transient state for years (the homogeneous solution of the nonhomogeneous second-order differential equation of harmonic oscillators). It's supposed to decay real quick, a clean slate, but for me, it just lingers like hell. 

"Am I living it right?" is a total paradox. It's logically pointless, because by the time you've figured it out â€” maybe after a couple of years, the moment has passed and the answer has likely been skewed by hindsight. The _superstitions_ that carried the doubt become meaningless, "negligible" terms in the equation of your past.

Yet, sometimes a sudden realization strikes you, even if it opposes beliefs that were established ages ago. Perhaps the only 'Georgia' that can truly resonate with me is myself. Persisting with this relentless self-questioning might be the only way to assure existence and make it 'detectable.' After all, there is no ultimate 'game' or final 'theory,' only strings that vibrate endlessly, searching for that sweet spot of resonance.

So the shifting of center, the drifting of matter resumes.
