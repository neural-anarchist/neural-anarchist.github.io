### Wow, time flies, it is my birthday again.

<br>For starters — a song I’m dedicating to myself for the rest of the year: “Whatever” by Oasis.<br><br>

<div class="fancy-notecard">
  There’s something timeless about it — defiant, but subtle - no matter how much the world tries to tame you, shape you, box you in... don’t give in. <br><br>
  Take it easy. Accept that hardships exist — they’re not exceptions, they’re always a part of the path. But don’t let them change the core of your spirit. <br><br>
  Stay curious. Stay true. Keep asking questions no one else dares to. Keep pushing even when no one’s watching. <br><br>
  And if no one else is in your corner —<br>
  <strong>I am.</strong><br>
  <i> I’m always on your side. </i>

### Lyrics for "Whatever":

<div class="lyrics">
  <p>
    I'm free to be whatever I<br>
    Whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want<br>
    I'm free to say whatever I<br>
    Whatever I like if it's wrong or right, it's alright
  </p>

  <p>
    Always seems to me<br>
    You only see what people want you to see<br>
    How long's it gonna be<br>
    Before we get on the bus and cause no fuss?<br>
    Get a grip on yourself it don't cost much<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Free to be whatever you<br>
    Whatever you say if it comes my way, it's alright<br>
    You're free to be wherever you<br>
    Wherever you please you can shoot the breeze if you want<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    It always seems to me<br>
    You only see what people want you to see<br>
    How long's it gonna be<br>
    Before we get on the bus and cause no fuss?<br>
    Get a grip on yourself it don't cost much<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Free to be whatever I<br>
    Whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm free to be whatever I<br>
    Whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want<br>
    I'm free to be whatever I<br>
    Whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Whatever you do, whatever you say<br>
    Yeah, I know it's alright<br>
    Whatever you do, whatever you say<br>
    Yeah, I know it's alright<br>
  </p>

<div class = "lyrics">

<p>
I once had a girl<br>
Or should I say she once had me<br>
She showed me her room<br>
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br>
</p>

<p>
She asked me to stay<br>
And she told me to sit anywhere<br>
So I looked around<br>
And I noticed there wasn't a chair<br>
</p>

<p>
I sat on a rug biding my time<br>
Drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two and then she said<br>
"It's time for bed"<br>
</p>

<p>
She told me she worked<br>
In the morning and started to laugh<br>
I told her I didn't<br>
And crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>
</p>

<p>
And when I awoke I was alone<br>
This bird had flown<br>
So I lit a fire<br>
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br>
</p>
</div>

<br>Also my sister (in 5th grade) made a birthday cake for me <ins>all by herself</ins>!!! Even though I know that she's a decent baker, but still, WOW!<br><br>

Tomorrow will be the first day of my AI/ML program, I'm really excited to meet up with my peers from across the world!
