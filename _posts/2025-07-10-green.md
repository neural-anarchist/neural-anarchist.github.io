## Green's Theorem - Statement

Let the vector field be:

$$
\vec{F} = P(x, y)\, \hat{i} + Q(x, y)\, \hat{j}
$$

If $$ C $$ is a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed curve in the plane and $$ D $$ is the region bounded by $$ C $$, then:

$$
\oint_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \oint_C P\,dx + Q\,dy = \iint_D \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right)\, dA
$$

## Using Greenâ€™s Theorem to Compute Area

We can compute the area of a region $$ D $$ using Greenâ€™s Theorem by selecting:

$$
P = -\frac{y}{2}, \quad Q = \frac{x}{2}
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{2}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
$$

Therefore, Greenâ€™s Theorem becomes:

$$
\text{Area} = \iint_D 1 \, dA = \oint_C \left( -\frac{y}{2} dx + \frac{x}{2} dy \right)
$$

Or more cleanly:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \oint_C (x\,dy - y\,dx)
}
$$

## Application: Area of a Circle of Radius $$ a $$

Let $$ C $$ be the positively oriented boundary of a circle of radius $$ a $$ centered at the origin.

Parametrize the circle as:

$$
x = a\cos\theta, \quad y = a\sin\theta, \quad \theta \in [0, 2\pi]
$$

Compute the differentials:

$$
dx = -a\sin\theta\, d\theta, \quad dy = a\cos\theta\, d\theta
$$

Now plug into the area formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} \left( a\cos\theta \cdot a\cos\theta - a\sin\theta \cdot (-a\sin\theta) \right) d\theta
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} a^2(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta)\, d\theta
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} a^2\, d\theta = \frac{1}{2} a^2 \cdot 2\pi = \boxed{\pi a^2}
$$

The theorem gives an elegant geometric interpretation of line integrals, also showing how vector calculus aligns with simple familiar results.

This would be extremely helpful when I start the E&M topics in physics. 

RIP my HRK progress btw (I should've learned calculus in middle school skull).
